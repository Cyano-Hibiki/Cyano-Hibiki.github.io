I'm Cyano, a Ph.D. student by day. During my free time I do 3D printing, make 3D models, experiment with my home lab server, play video games, and watch Anime. 

## Tinkering

### 3D Printing
I own and operate two FDM printers at the moment, a Prusa Mk4 and an Ender 3 v2. I am also in the process of building my Voron 2.4.

### 3D Modeling
I self-taught SolidWorks and Fusion 360 when I was part of a robotics club at my university. I mostly make functional mechanical parts, but I'm also branching into artistic models.

### Home Lab
I built a home lab server using old PC parts and installed Proxmox on it. I run various VMs and containers for all kinds of services.

## Entertainment

### Video Games
I am a big fan of PC games, particularly in the shooter and simulation categories. Currently, I am actively playing Helldivers 2 and War Thunder.

### Anime 
TBD.
